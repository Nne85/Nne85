### Hi there 👋

👩🏾 About me

I am Nnenna Kehinde, a Software Engineer(specializing in Backend Development). A software engineering graduate of ALX_Africa.

- 🌱 I enjoy learning new languages. I started learning PHP and collaborated with my team to build an e-commerce store. I am currently learning C and Python. I also design great visual UI interfaces when I am not coding.

- 📚 I love reading crime-fiction books and history. (Hmm 🙄 maybe I would have been a detective). Well, I love reading, and reading programming concepts is fun too.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I love old-school songs. They are the best❤.
